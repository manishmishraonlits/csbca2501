Programming Language: Language to write programs
	1. Low Level Programming - (Machine & Assembly Language)
	2. High Level Programming - (C, C++, Java, Python)

Paradigm: Principles/Techniques used for writing programs.
	1. POP (Procedure Oriented Programming)
	2. OOP (Object Oriented Programming)	

Jargon

#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>

Addition of two integer		(Verbose)
 1. Ask the first integer.
 2. Read and store it.
 3. Ask the second integer.
 4. Read and store it.
 5. Find the sum and store.
 6. Tell the sum.

Programming and Problem Solving using C

floating point numbers

Algorithm is a step by step solution of a problem.

Philosophy

Algorithm: Read two integer and find their sum.
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read a, b		scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
Step 3: c = a + b		c = a + b;
Step 4: Print c			printf("%d", c);
Step 5: Stop

TC1	:	Inputs: a = 10, b = 20
		Output: c = 30

TC2	:	Inputs: a = 1, b = 999
		Output: c = 1000

TC3	:	Inputs: a = 5000000000, b = 6000000000
		Output: c = 11000000000

TC4	:	Inputs: a = 0, b = 0
		Output: c = 0

TC5	:	Inputs: a = -110, b = -220
		Output: c = -330

find his total marks obtained.


I	-	Input
P	-	Process
O	-	Output

Algorithm: to read marks scored by a student in any three subjects and 
find his total marks obtained.
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read m1, m2, m3
Step 3: tm = m1 + m2 + m3
Step 4: Print tm
Step 5: Stop

3. Write an algorithm to read length and breadth of a rectangle and find its area.
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read l, b		scanf("%d%d", &l, &b);
Step 3: a = l * b		a = l * b;
Step 4: Print a			printf("%d", a);
Step 5: Stop

4. Write an algorithm to read principle, rate and time and calculate simple interest.
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read p, r, t
Step 3: si = (p*r*t)/100
Step 4: Print si
Step 5: Stop

5. Write an algorithm to read temperature in degree Celsius and convert it into degree
   Fahrenheit.
6. Write an algorithm to read radius of a circle and find its circumference and area.
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read r
Step 3: c = 2 * 3.14 * r
Step 4: a = 3.14 * r * r
Step 5: Print c, a
Step 6: Stop
